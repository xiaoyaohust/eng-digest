      <title>Architecting efficient context-aware multi-agent framework for production</title>
      <link>https://developers.googleblog.com/architecting-efficient-context-aware-multi-agent-framework-for-production/</link>
      <description>ADK introduces **Context Engineering** to scale AI agents beyond large context windows It treats context as a compiled view over a tiered, stateful system (**Session, Memory, Artifacts**) This architecture uses explicit processors for transformation, enables efficient compaction and caching, and allows for strict, scoped context handoffs in multi-agent workflows to ensure reliability and cost-effectiveness in production.</description>

      <description>We need the LLM to generate a Graph Search Filter DSL statement that is syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically correct.Syntactic correctness is easy — does it parse For some fields, there is additional information we can provide beyond what’s available in the schema as well, in particular permissible values that pull from controlled vocabularies.Each field in the index is associated with metadata as seen below, and that metadata is provided as part of the context.Graph Search index representationThe field is derived from the document path as characterized by the GraphQL query.The description is the comment from the GraphQL schema for the field.The type is derived from the GraphQL schema for the field e.g This design strategically balances LLM involvement with more deterministic strategies.End-to-end architectureThe end-to-end process is as follows:A user’s natural language question (with optional `@mentions` statements) are provided as input, along with the Graph Search index contextThe context is scoped by using the RAG pattern on both fields and possible valuesThe pre-processed context and the question are fed into the LLM with an instruction asking for a syntactically and semantically correct filter statementThe generated filer statement DSL is verified and checked for hallucinationsThe final response contains the related AST in order to build “Chips” and “Facets”SummaryBy combining our existing Graph Search infrastructure with the power and flexibility of LLMs, we’ve bridged the gap between complex filter statements and user intent</description>

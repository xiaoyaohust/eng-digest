### 1. Scaling LLM Post-Training at Netflix

**URL:** https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-llm-post-training-at-netflix-0046f8790194?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4

**Published:** 2026-02-13 08:05

**Summary:**

This blog describes the architecture and engineering philosophy of our internal Post-Training Framework, built by the AI Platform team to hide infrastructure complexity so researchers and model developers can focus on model innovation — not distributed systems plumbing.A Model Developer’s Post-Training JourneyPost-training often starts deceptively simply: curate proprietary domain data, load an open-weight model from Hugging Face, and iterate batches through it In particular, we extend Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) style SFT workloads to run online RL with a hybrid single-controller + SPMD execution model, which we’ll describe next.Today, this framework supports research use cases ranging from post-training large-scale foundation models to fine-tuning specialized expert models Rather than training directly on transformers model classes, we maintain our own optimized, unified model definitions that can still load/save Hugging Face checkpoints

### 2. Automating RDS Postgres to Aurora Postgres Migration

**URL:** https://netflixtechblog.com/automating-rds-postgres-to-aurora-postgres-migration-261ca045447f?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4

**Published:** 2026-02-12 14:07

**Summary:**

At this stage, the Aurora cluster is created and attached to the RDS PostgreSQL primary as a replica, establishing continuous replication from the source RDS PostgreSQL instance The cluster is fully operational for validation and performance testing, but it is not yet writable — RDS remains the authoritative primary.Quiescence PhaseThe goal of the quiescence phase is to transition client applications from the source RDS PostgreSQL instance to the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster as the new primary database, while preserving data consistency during cutover.The first step in this process is to stop all write traffic to the source RDS PostgreSQL instance to guarantee consistency In addition, any logical replication slots removed during the migration must be recreated so that CDC consumers can continue processing changes from the source database.Once connectivity and replication slots are restored, the RDS PostgreSQL instance can safely resume its role as the primary source of truth.Post-quiescence Rolling back after cutover, once the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster is serving production traffic, is significantly more complex

### 3. The AI Evolution of Graph Search at Netflix

**URL:** https://netflixtechblog.com/the-ai-evolution-of-graph-search-at-netflix-d416ec5b1151?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4

**Published:** 2026-01-26 19:01

**Summary:**

We need the LLM to generate a Graph Search Filter DSL statement that is syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically correct.Syntactic correctness is easy — does it parse For some fields, there is additional information we can provide beyond what’s available in the schema as well, in particular permissible values that pull from controlled vocabularies.Each field in the index is associated with metadata as seen below, and that metadata is provided as part of the context.Graph Search index representationThe field is derived from the document path as characterized by the GraphQL query.The description is the comment from the GraphQL schema for the field.The type is derived from the GraphQL schema for the field e.g This design strategically balances LLM involvement with more deterministic strategies.End-to-end architectureThe end-to-end process is as follows:A user’s natural language question (with optional `@mentions` statements) are provided as input, along with the Graph Search index contextThe context is scoped by using the RAG pattern on both fields and possible valuesThe pre-processed context and the question are fed into the LLM with an instruction asking for a syntactically and semantically correct filter statementThe generated filer statement DSL is verified and checked for hallucinationsThe final response contains the related AST in order to build “Chips” and “Facets”SummaryBy combining our existing Graph Search infrastructure with the power and flexibility of LLMs, we’ve bridged the gap between complex filter statements and user intent

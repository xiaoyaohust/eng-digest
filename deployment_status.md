Check GitHub Pages Deployment Status
Method 1: Actions Page

Visit: https://github.com/xiaoyaohust/eng-digest/actions

Find the pages build and deployment workflow

Check the latest run status (green ✓ = success, red ✗ = failed)

Method 2: Settings Page

Visit: https://github.com/xiaoyaohust/eng-digest/settings/pages

Look at the top for a green notification box saying:
"Your site is live at https://xiaoyaohust.github.io/eng-digest/
"

If it shows "Your site is ready to be published"

This means the first deployment is still pending. Please wait 5–10 minutes.

If it shows an error

Possible reasons:

The repository is Private (needs to be changed to Public)

Incorrect branch setting (should be main)

Incorrect folder setting (should be / root)
